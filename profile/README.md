**`git-emoji`** is a side project that aims at making tools (e.g., IDE/browser extensions, CLI tools, or git hooks) promoting the usage of emoji (aka, smiley or emoticon) in software development process, starting from git commit messages.

## Why Emojis?

Technically because they're terse (single-letter words), meaningful, and available virtually everywhere. In some way, they're the most friendly beings in textual context to our brain's image perception where instantaneous semantic extraction happens. So, reading emojis is quite faster than interpreting texts. Another reason is seeing emojis around is fun and cute.

## Open dataset

To build tools we'd first need a viable dataset of emojis and their contextual meanings. To make this dataset easily accessible there's this repository, [`git-emoji/dataset-js`][dataset], which provides the data in JavaScript importable format. The dataset is published under MIT so **everyone** can openly use it. We'd love to see your contributions as issues or pull requests. üçè
